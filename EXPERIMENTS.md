# CF Onboarding Experiments

The goal of this document is to help facilitators share experiments that we have done over time and their various outcomes.

### 3 day onboarding

3 days was a little too short. 4 might be better.

### Explicit lecture series with video artifacts for onboarding.

Having videos really helps lower facilitator load but reduces chanes for questions. We have tried to do Q&A sessions to fill these gaps and those have gone well. This is a tough balance, since facilitators are generally voulenteer.

## TODO

- Add more examples.
- Add google forms and data related to who attendies are and what they got out of the event.
