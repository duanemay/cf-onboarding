I started working on a new email template for an unusual set of attendees and realized I could get most of both emails into one. There was also some general improvements that I think might be nice to drive back into the original emails.

These two are not new to the org and are not in CF so they are kind of an interesting persona for onboarding.

Here is the message I sent:
```
Hey Jen and Matt,

I know you two are interested in CF Onboarding and I wanted to  give you an idea about what to expect.

For starters, facilitators usually continue working their "day jobs," but check in regularly to answer questions and make sure everyone is doing well. We also generally do a morning stand up at 9:30 ish.

It looks like the current Seattle group would just be you two (Though I see there are also two in SF we might be able to have join us). The day to day is largely working on stories out of a Tracker backlog. These stories explore user journeys and workflows central to the CF ecosystem -- deploying CF with BOSH, pushing an app, debugging broken systems. The stories can get a bit technical, but by and large hold your hand quite a bit. It is expected that you will help each other out as much as possible, write down what you learn, and think about how difficulties you have with the stories could be feedback for us as facilitators or for teams that build the products you'll use.

Ideally you will be pairing full time. The core curriculum usually takes three days of pairing; plus there are at least two days of additional "pick your own adventure" style stories. So, your teams should expect you to be away for the majority of a week. If you generally have a lot of meetings we recommend cancelling or moving as many of them as possible, but if you need to step out for a meeting here or there, that shouldn't be a problem.

We don't have a specific time picked right now but CF R&D needs PMs so it would probably be good to get you working on this sooner rather than later.

General action items for attendees:
1. Let appropriate people know that you'll be away for CF Onboarding.
2. On the Monday morning (of our choosing), we'll start with an Onboarding orientation. Then we'll then set you up with pre-populated Pivotal Tracker project with stories, and we'll send you on your way.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Brendan
